# Lenia-Inspired Artificial Life Simulation

This project is an immersive, interactive artificial life simulation inspired by the complex cellular automata system known as Lenia. Built with A-frame for a 3D web experience, it allows users to explore, interact with, and evolve complex life forms in real-time. This README provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, how to use it, and how contributors can get involved.

## Overview

Our simulation brings to life the principles of Lenia, extending them into a 3D immersive environment where artificial life forms exhibit fascinating behaviors. Through user interaction, these entities can evolve, adapt, and form ecosystems, showcasing the beauty of complex systems.

## Features

- **3D Interactive Environment**: Explore artificial life in a fully 3D space, built on A-frame for an immersive experience.
- **Real-time Evolution**: Interact with the simulation to influence the evolution of life forms.
- **Community Sharing**: Share and discover unique life forms created by the community.
- **Performance Optimized**: Client-side focus with performance optimizations for smooth real-time interactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version)
- A modern web browser supporting WebGL and WebAssembly

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    bashCopy code

    `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lenia-in-aframe.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    bashCopy code

    `cd lenia-in-aframe`

3. Install dependencies:

    bashCopy code

    `npm install`

4. Run the development server:

    bashCopy code

    `npm run dev`

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the simulation.

## Usage

- **Interact**: Click and drag to interact with the life forms and environment.
- **Evolve**: Use the control panel to adjust parameters and influence the evolution of species.
- **Share**: Save your unique life forms and share them with the community through the in-built sharing feature.

## Contributing
